# hydrogen-pfhx
Chemical engineering model of hydrogen plate-fin heat exchanger

## Installation
pip install hydrogen-pfhx

## Usage
hydrogen-pfhx is used to model the cryogenic plate-fin heat exchanger used within hydrogen liquefaction plants.
Two examples are given below:

1. Run with a python IDE (e.g. visual studio)
see the example file "tests/test_model.py"
https://github.com/fsr-uwa/hydrogen-pfhx/blob/main/tests/test_model.py

2. A notebook using google colab 
see the notebook "tests/test_model.ipynb"
a. open colab (https://colab.research.google.com/) and select new notebook
b. Copy & paste contents of the notebook "tests/test_model.ipynb" then "File > Save a copy in drive" to the default location in drive (MyDrive/Colab Notebooks/)
c. also save the default configuration file (https://github.com/fsr-uwa/hydrogen-pfhx/blob/main/configs/default_configuration.yaml) to the same default drive location
d. open the notebook in colab and run
